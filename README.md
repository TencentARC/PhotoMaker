## üö© **New Features/Updates**
- ‚úÖ July 22, 2024. üí• We release PhotoMaker V2 with **improved ID fidelity**. At the same time, it still maintains the generation quality, editability, and compatibility with any plugins that PhotoMaker V1 offers. We have also provided scripts for integration with [ControlNet](./inference_scripts/inference_pmv2_contronet.py), [T2I-Adapter](./inference_scripts/inference_pmv2_t2i_adapter.py), and [IP-Adapter](./inference_scripts/inference_pmv2_ip_adapter.py) to offer excellent control capabilities. Users can further customize scripts for upgrades, such as combining with LCM for acceleration or integrating with IP-Adapter-FaceID or InstantID to further improve ID fidelity. We will release technical report of PhotoMaker V2 soon. Please refer to [this doc](./README_pmv2.md) for a quick preview. 
- ‚úÖ January 20, 2024. An **important** note: For those GPUs that do not support bfloat16, please change [this line](https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/blob/6ec44fc13909d64a65c635b9e3b6f238eb1de9fe/gradio_demo/app.py#L39) to `torch_dtype = torch.float16`, the speed will be **greatly improved** (1min/img (before) vs. 14s/img (after) on V100). The minimum GPU memory requirement for PhotoMaker is **11G** (Please refer to [this link](https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/discussions/114) for saving GPU memory).
- ‚úÖ January 15, 2024. We release PhotoMaker.

# üîß Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.8 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 2.0.0](https://pytorch.org/)
```bash
conda create --name photomaker python=3.10
conda activate photomaker
pip install -U pip

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install photomaker
pip install git+https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker.git
```

Then you can run the following command to use it
```python
from photomaker import PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline
```

# ‚è¨ Download Models 
The model will be automatically downloaded through the following two lines:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
photomaker_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="TencentARC/PhotoMaker", filename="photomaker-v1.bin", repo_type="model")
```

You can also choose to download manually from this [url](https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/PhotoMaker).

# üíª How to Test

## Use like [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)

- Dependency
```py
import torch
import os
from diffusers.utils import load_image
from diffusers import EulerDiscreteScheduler
from photomaker import PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline

### Load base model
pipe = PhotoMakerStableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(
    base_model_path,  # can change to any base model based on SDXL
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    use_safetensors=True, 
    variant="fp16"
).to(device)

### Load PhotoMaker checkpoint
pipe.load_photomaker_adapter(
    os.path.dirname(photomaker_path),
    subfolder="",
    weight_name=os.path.basename(photomaker_path),
    trigger_word="img"  # define the trigger word
)     

pipe.scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)

### Also can cooperate with other LoRA modules
# pipe.load_lora_weights(os.path.dirname(lora_path), weight_name=lora_model_name, adapter_name="xl_more_art-full")
# pipe.set_adapters(["photomaker", "xl_more_art-full"], adapter_weights=[1.0, 0.5])

pipe.fuse_lora()
```

- Input ID Images
```py
### define the input ID images
input_folder_name = './examples/newton_man'
image_basename_list = os.listdir(input_folder_name)
image_path_list = sorted([os.path.join(input_folder_name, basename) for basename in image_basename_list])

input_id_images = []
for image_path in image_path_list:
    input_id_images.append(load_image(image_path))
```

<div align="center">

<a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/assets/21050959/01d53dfa-7528-4f09-a1a5-96b349ae7800" align="center"><img style="margin:0;padding:0;" src="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/assets/21050959/01d53dfa-7528-4f09-a1a5-96b349ae7800"/></a>
</div>

- Generation
```py
# Note that the trigger word `img` must follow the class word for personalization
prompt = "a half-body portrait of a man img wearing the sunglasses in Iron man suit, best quality"
negative_prompt = "(asymmetry, worst quality, low quality, illustration, 3d, 2d, painting, cartoons, sketch), open mouth, grayscale"
generator = torch.Generator(device=device).manual_seed(42)
images = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    input_id_images=input_id_images,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    num_images_per_prompt=1,
    num_inference_steps=num_steps,
    start_merge_step=10,
    generator=generator,
).images[0]
gen_images.save('out_photomaker.png')
```

<div align="center">

<a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/assets/21050959/703c00e1-5e50-4c19-899e-25ee682d2c06" align="center"><img width=400 style="margin:0;padding:0;" src="https://github.com/TencentARC/PhotoMaker/assets/21050959/703c00e1-5e50-4c19-899e-25ee682d2c06"/></a>

## Start a local gradio demo
Run the following command:

```python
python gradio_demo/app.py
```

You could customize this script in [this file](gradio_demo/app.py).

If you want to run it on MAC, you should follow [this Instruction](MacGPUEnv.md) and then run the app.py.

## Usage Tips:
- Upload more photos of the person to be customized to improve ID fidelity. If the input is Asian face(s), maybe consider adding 'Asian' before the class word, e.g., `Asian woman img`
- When stylizing, does the generated face look too realistic? Adjust the Style strength to 30-50, the larger the number, the less ID fidelity, but the stylization ability will be better. You could also try out other base models or LoRAs with good stylization effects.
- Reduce the number of generated images and sampling steps for faster speed. However, please keep in mind that reducing the sampling steps may compromise the ID fidelity.
